Utilities
=========

Utilities is a collection of helpers and extension methods for quickly solving and aiding with common .NET programming tasks.

You can add these utilities to your project via NuGet by running the following commands in the package manager console. 

- Install-Package Utilities.Core
- Install-Package Utilities.Web

This is an ongoing project, I will be adding methods as and when I need them.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/DamianMullins/Utilities/wiki) for descriptions of the classes and their methods.
